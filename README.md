# Book Grabber

This web application offers a book exchange service to its users. Users may create an account and add books to build their personal library within the app. Users may browse the entire collection of all books from all users in the app. Upon finding a book of interest, the user may create a request to get a book from another user. Book requests, including those made by the user and those made to the user, may be managed on the user's Tasks page. 

Book Grabber was built was Rails 5.2.3 and uses bcrypt to protect sensitive data.
